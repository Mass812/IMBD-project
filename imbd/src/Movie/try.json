His only neighbors were the wolves and grizzly bears and his only transportation was his canoe and a good set of legs. Through the years, Dick kept written journals of daily life at Twin Lakes but would also document much of his adventure on film with his 16 mms Bolex camera. The Frozen North is Dick's own filmed account of his life alone in this \"One Man's Wilderness\", produced from original footage not included in \"Alone in the Wilderness\" or \"Alaska Silence &amp; Solitude\".",
